## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this? 

Mastering the skill of understanding and incorporating user needs into a program involves communicating those needs effectively. The creation of "user stories" significantly aids in this process. This skill develops over time, and maintaining open communication with end-users allows for the implementation of various changes through incremental releases. User stories give the developers opportunities to find out more about the specifics and details. With these details, I can effectively interpret the user’s needs and produce something that exceeds expectations.
