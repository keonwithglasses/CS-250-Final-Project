## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this? 

Mastering the skill of understanding and incorporating user needs into a program involves communicating those needs effectively. The creation of "user stories" significantly aids in this process. This skill develops over time, and maintaining open communication with end-users allows for the implementation of various changes through incremental releases. User stories give the developers opportunities to find out more about the specifics and details. With these details, I can effectively interpret the user’s needs and produce something that exceeds expectations.  

## How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work? 

After getting the opportunity to learn about agile methodologies, I feel confident with the tools I have and how I can use them to develop programs. The initial step into developing a program is maintaining organization, and agile would be the perfect framework because not only does it foster organization, but it also embodies flexibility and adaptability. Utilizing software tools like Azure, Jira, and even Github is something that I believe would be beneficial to developing programs. With program development, I plan to integrate agile processes such as Scrum, user stories, daily stand-up meetings, retrospectives, and backlog prioritization. This approach emphasizes adaptability, ongoing communication, and continuous improvement, ensuring a collaborative and effective development environment. 

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development? 

There are so many factors that go into being a good team member in any setting, but when it comes to software development there’s one core thing, and that is knowing that you work as a team. A team consists of people with varying opinions and set skills. Once we’re able to put aside personal ego and even the amount of experience, the better off we will be as individuals. This will help everyone work together towards the goal and even gain insight afterwards.
